## 3 Unique inputs
(1) Text input to specify information such as First Name, (2) Radio to indicate what resume template to use (3) Dropdown to indicate the Day, Month, and Year of a particular event

## Packages

## Code style divergences
None that I can think of

## Notes for instructor
I used the same design as before, but altered it to hopefully work better by making it less complicated
